For the d3 bar graph visual, 
I made the following changes in Excel to get 
from 18_germany_demographics_coefficients_and_average.csv
to data-model.csv

1) removed the first and last row, containing the outcome variable and intercep
2) flipped dummy descriptions where necessary so that the coefficients all had a positive sign (e.g., from religious to non-religious)
3) reorderd based on the absolute size of the coefficients
4) changed the variable names to the text I want to show below the ticks on the x axis
5) added a fourth column with the text I want to show up when hovering over bars
