About Us
This website and its content were developed by Harvard Kennedy School students as part of their coursework for the class Programming and Data for Policymakers taught by Adjunct Lecturer Dhrumil Mehta (https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/dhrumil-mehta ). The website was developed using scrum in two sprints over the course of two weeks and was documented in github (Link to scrum board).
